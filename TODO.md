# TODOs for beta relase

  * Location coordinates
    * Clean up clusters
    * Maybe treat e.g. tables as a single location with multiple checks

  * Remove excess code from SoM tracker
    * random unused files
    * clean up content from layouts

  * Maybe polish
    * Should chunks/nuggets change visually with count?
    * More correct nugget image
    * Wallet change visually with count?

# TODOs for future

  * Settings that can affect logic:

    * Normal mode (uses trackers)
        * did I back myself into a corner or is importing this reasonable?

    * Very Hard mode

    * Minor glitches

    * Other flags AP might develop

  * Logic for early Sootling on a Leash (abilities_hook) 

  * Locations for bucket, vine like leash sootling? (Probably not)

  * Full bucket, used spores, used keys, etc?
    * If AP implements beelines some of this will become mandatory

  * Per-zone tabs with linked locations?

  * custom chest_[un]opened_img for wickerlings/scarabs/chests/etc

  * Switch font in images to Sniglet

# AUTOTRACKING

  * Small number of checks whose names are swapped
    * Scarabs 62/63 Crystal Skull Right/Left
    * Scarabs 37/38

  * Kazoos are only recorded under quests

  * AP doesn't report abilities_hook or instruments (or their locations)
