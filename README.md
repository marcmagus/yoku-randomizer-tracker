This a tracker package for PopTracker or other compatible programs to use with the built-in Randomizer mode of [Yoku's Island Express](http://yokugame.com)

Also check out the [Yoku Speedrunning Discord]().

PopTracker can be found [here](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/releases).

Alternatively, EmoTracker can be found [here](https://emotracker.net).

This package, and especially the below instructions, are based on the [Secret of Mana Open World Tracker](https://github.com/Cyb3RGER/SoM-Open-Mode-Tracker). Thanks for the great base.

## Installation

Just download the lastest build and put in your packs folder (as a zip or unpacked, both works).

### PopTracker

For PopTracker the packs folder can be under `USER/Documents/PopTracker/packs`, `USER/PopTracker/packs` or `APP/packs`, where `USER` stands for your user directory and `APP` for the PopTracker installation directory.

### EmoTracker

For EmoTracker the packs folder can be found under `USER/Documents/EmoTracker/packs`, where `USER` stands for your user directory.

## Customization

### PopTracker

For Customization in PopTracker just edit the pack's files. Documenation for PopTracker's pack format can be found [here](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/blob/master/doc/PACKS.md).
For example: if you want to change the broadcast layout, you can add your desired layout to the `layout/broadcast.json` file.
Make sure you have you layout backed up tho, so you don't lose it when you override the file while updating the pack.

### EmoTracker

For Customization in EmoTracker you overwrite the pack's file by placing the file in EmoTracks overrides folder (`USER/Documents/EmoTracker/user_overides`). Good luck finding a documenation for EmoTracker tho :3.

## Autotracking

There is no autotracking support at this time.
